**Rapid** is a tool for Rapid Application Development & Rapid Prototyping for the iPhone/iPod touch.
With Rapid, you can easily create database applications for the iPhone/iPod touch **without any programming knowledge**. You simply launch the program in the iPhone Simulator or on the iPhone (if you are member of the iPhone Developer Program and have the required certificates) and design your application using the provided GUI. Your application is automatically stored in a declarative format and ready to use immediately. You can download the prepared **Xcode project** and start designing your application **right now** (the only thing you need is the iPhone SDK which can be downloaded for free here: http://developer.apple.com/iphone/; you will need a free Apple ID).

The **enclosed Xcode project** contains two sample forms with data fields so that you can see how **iPhone databases** can be designed.

**NB:** You can use Rapid with the free object database for iPhone OS: [EntropyDB](http://entropydb.googlecode.com/)
