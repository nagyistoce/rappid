First of all, you have to be clear about what you want to store in the database. Before using the tool, make a list of forms you would like to have, and for each form make a list of data fields.

After launching the application, click on _Forms_ and create a record for each form. Then click on _Form fields_ and create a record for each data field of all forms.

The forms you have designed can be used to create/edit/remove records after relaunching the application.
